  3. On the left-hand side, the user may proceed to one of three options: 1) Search for an Artist: 2) Search for a Song: 3) Search for an Album:
  4. User will be prompted with the most popular hit on Spotify given their input in each respective search input bar and the user will be presented with an option to "Add" to their own personal playlist.
  5. All items added by the user will appear on the "music" tab on the left-hand side of the application below the search bars.
  6. On the User's unique playlist page, the user may click on any song and it will play. The user may click pause at any moment and play another song as he/she wishes.
  7. The user can then click on "Our Team" at the bottom left corner to visit each of our developer's profile page and link to GitHub repositories.
